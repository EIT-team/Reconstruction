Add tests here. 

They'll need in some cases "gold" files, i.e. files your functions should output when working as expected. These should be produced beforehand and uploaded here (if <100MB) or to the Research Data space. The test will run the funcions and check if the outputs coincide with the 'gold' file/s. Some guidelines for testing in MatLab [here](http://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/write-unit-tests-1.html).
